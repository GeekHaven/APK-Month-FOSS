## ðŸ§  Task 2a: Understanding Merge Conflicts via `enroll.txt`

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Simulate and resolve a merge conflict by making conflicting changes to the same line in different branches.

### ðŸ“„ File Involved:
- `enroll.txt in Task2 folder`

### ðŸ§© Task Requirements:

1. On the `main` branch, make a change to the **first line** of `enroll.txt` and commit it.  
   *(Example: Add your name or a unique string)*

2. Create a **new branch** from `main`.

3. In this new branch, edit the **same first line** of `enroll.txt` but with a different change, and commit it.

4. Switch back to `main` and merge the new branch into it.

5. A **merge conflict** should occur. Resolve the conflict manually.

6. Commit the merge after resolving the conflict.
   
7.  Make a pull request

### âœ… Completion Criteria:
- The repository should contain **3 commits**:
  1. Initial change on `main`
  2. Conflicting change on the new branch
  3. Merge commit after resolving the conflict

- The final version of `enroll.txt` should reflect the resolved content.
